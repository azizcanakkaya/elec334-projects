# elec334-projects

A set of projects made through out the semester. Keep in mind that these are some register level programming and has some missing part (not in project 1). To learn more about the missing parts dive into reports. These projects will be rewritten with HAL library in the future.

## stm32g0

Examples for using Cortex-M0+ based stm32g0 processor. All the examples are made 
for Nucleo G031K8 board. The pinouts and all the alternative functionality of 
the board is given in the Figure below.
